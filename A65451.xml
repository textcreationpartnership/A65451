            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE SPEECH Of the HONOURABLE Sir <hi>WILLIAM WENTWORTH,</hi> One of His Majeſties Privy Council in <hi>Ireland:</hi> To the Magiſtrates and Citizens of the City of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> in the <hi>Town-hall,</hi> before the Proclaiming of the King.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>GENTLEMEN,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>SINCE his late Majeſty was pleaſed to do me that great Honour, as to make me one of his Privy Council in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and that his now Majeſty is alſo graciouſly pleaſed to do me the ſame Honour, I think it my duty to declare to you what I know of this High and Mighty Prince, King <hi>James</hi> the Second: Who is the greateſt Captain at Sea and Land now living, nor is there mention in Hiſtory of any one which did ever equal him in both, for Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, Skill, and Conduct. Never did ſo great a Warriour ſit upon our Throne, never ſo great a Souldier wear our Crown, never any one of our Princes was more knowing in the Laws and Conſtitutions of theſe three Kingdoms; never any of greater Moderation, Sobriety, and Temperance. A more affectionate Brother was never known, nor a more Dutiful and Obedient Subject; elſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could have made him abſent himſelf, when ſo many Calumnies and Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries were falling upon him. I have followed this great King, and been with him in all the Countries and Places to which he was ſent, and have heard him both in his Publick and Private Retirements, declare and promiſe that he would main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as it is now Eſtabliſhed, and upon my Life he will do it, and make it as great, nay greater, than either his Brother, Father or Grand-Father did; for he hath conſtantlye and faithfully preſerved his Word and Promiſe, and I dare ſay, not one in theſe three Kingdomes, ever had either from him for any thing but he did perform it. He is a ſtrict obſerver of Laws, no advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage whatſoever could make him break any of them; a Prince he is that did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fear any thing but to do an ill, or an unjuſt Act; and from doing Juſtice and maintaining His and his Peoples Rights, nothing whatſoever of danger or diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
<pb facs="tcp:36843:2"/> can ſtop or hinder him; and ſince his frequent and late promiſes to maintain our Church of <hi>England</hi> in its Rights, all the powers on Earth or their threats can make him break or depart from them; nor any perſon whatſoever, let his Authority be never ſo great, can make him forſake or recal the ſame: he will be ſooner Torn in Pieces than be drawn from his word, nothing can ſeparate him from his promiſes. I have heard him declare in the Parliament of <hi>Scotland,</hi> in an Excellent Speech, that he would maintain that Form of Government in their Church as truly as any one of his Predeceſſors had done; and yet he, as well as we, knows that upon it was built that late Horrid Rebellion, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe this laſt Damnable Conſpiracy had thence much of its Riſe, and I dare ſay at or before this day, he hath ſent them all the aſſurances of performing it: and therefore how can we have the leaſt apprehenſion he will not maintain this our Church, of which not one Member did ever forſake his Father's, or his Brothers Rights, and for which that Glorious Martyr (his Father) did chiefly ſuffer: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let no fear poſſeſs you, for he will endeavour its Peace and Proſperity. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo dear to him as the welfare of his People: God Almighty ſend him but length of days, then our Nation and Trades are ſure to Flouriſh; then Glory and Riches will ſurely come and abide among us; then we ſhall all think our Lives and Fortunes well laid out; and given him, ſince there's nothing but his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken away, can take away our Peace and Proſperity, let us all pray, <hi>God ſave the King, Long live the King.</hi> Amen.</p>
